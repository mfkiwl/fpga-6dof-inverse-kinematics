# fpga-6dof-inverse-kinematics
It is based on Xilinx Artix-7 100T FPGA with Vivado using Verilog and hosts the RISC-V processor. It introduces an inverse kinematics algorithm that controls 6 degrees of freedom robotic arms and a sensor-based automatic control system. All systems are hardware-synthesized and work simultaneously.
